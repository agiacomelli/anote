# anote
A note-taking- & notes-visualizing script for the contemporary \*Nix power-user living part-time in the terminal and part-time in the browser

There are many note-taking applications araound. Far too many, considered what I need most: a way to drop a line on the terminal, and a place where that line was stored permanently and some other way to show me all I dropped.

**With anote, you would do the following:**

$ anote Don't forget to do X, and by the way do Y, while you're doing X and Z anyway

The program stores the line to a file, with all the other crap and renders an html-file, which you can view on your browser.

What I don't like about most note-taking apps, is the styling. They all look crappy. I needed a safe place for my notes, and two simple ways to access them. And as I live part-time in the browser and part-time on the command line, this seemed the way to go.
